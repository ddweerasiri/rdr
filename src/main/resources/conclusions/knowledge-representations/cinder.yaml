options:
  openstack-origin:
    default: distro
    type: string
    description: |
      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
      cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
      cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

      When deploying to Precise, the default distro option will use
      the cloud:precise-folsom/updates repository instead, since Cinder
      was not available in the Ubuntu archive for Precise and is only
      available via the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.
  enabled-services:
    default: all
    type: string
    description: |
      If splitting cinder services between units, define which services
      to install and configure.
  block-device:
    default: sdb
    type: string
    description: |
      The block devices on which to create LVM volume group.

      May be set to None for deployments that will not need local
      storage (eg, Ceph/RBD-backed volumes).

      This can also be a space delimited list of block devices to attempt
      to use in the cinder LVM volume group - each block device detected
      will be added to the available physical volumes in the volume group.

      May be set to the path and size of a local file
      (/path/to/file.img|$sizeG), which will be created and used as a
      loopback device (for testing only).  $sizeG defaults to 5G
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    default: 3
    type: int
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores withing the cinder rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the cinder
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
      your ceph cluster).
  volume-group:
    default: cinder-volumes
    type: string
    description: Name of volume group to create and store Cinder volumes.
  overwrite:
    default: "false"
    type: string
    description: |
      If true, URep will attempt to overwrite block devices containing
      previous filesystems or LVM, assuming it is not in use.
  remove-missing:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If True, URep will attempt to remove missing physical volumes from
      volume group, if logical volumes are not allocated on them.

    type: int
    description: OpenStack Volume API listening port.
  region:
    default: RegionOne
    type: string
    description: OpenStack Region
  glance-api-version:
    default: 1
    type: int
    description: |
      Newer storage drivers may require the v2 Glance API to perform certain
      actions e.g. the RBD driver requires requires this to support COW
      cloning of images. This option will default to v1 for backwards
      compatibility older glance services.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      By default, all services will log into their corresponding log files.
      Setting this to True will force all services to log to the syslog.

    type: boolean
    description: Enable debug logging
  verbose:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: Enable verbose logging
  # HA configuration settings

      .
      If multiple networks are being used, a VIP should be provided for each
      network, separated by spaces.
  vip_iface:
    type: string
    default: eth0
    description: |
      Default network interface to use for HA vip when it cannot be automatically
      determined.
  vip_cidr:
    type: int
    default: 24
    description: |
      Default CIDR netmask to use for HA vip when it cannot be automatically
      determined.

  # Per-service HTTPS configuration.
  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      SSL certificate to install and use for API ports.  Setting this value
      and ssl_key will enable reverse proxying, point Glance's entry in the
      Keystone catalog to use https, and override any certficiate and key
      issued by Keystone (if it is configured to do so).
  ssl_key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: SSL key to use with certificate specified as ssl_cert.
  ssl_ca:
    type: string

      The IP address and netmask of the OpenStack Admin network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      This network will be used for admin endpoints.
  os-internal-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the OpenStack Internal network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      This network will be used for internal endpoints.
  os-public-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the OpenStack Public network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)

      This network will be used for public endpoints.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The URep will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these UReps do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this URep to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  worker-multiplier:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      The CPU core multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for
      Cinder.  By default, the number of workers for each daemon is set to
      twice the number of CPU cores a service unit has.
  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate URep.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
