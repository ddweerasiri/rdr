  service-guard:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Ensure required relations are made and complete before allowing services
      to be started
      .
      By default, services may be up and accepting API request from install
      onwards.
      .
      Enabling this flag ensures that services will not be started until the
      minimum 'core relations' have been made between this charm and other
      charms.
      .
      For this charm the following relations must be made:
      .
        * shared-db or (pgsql-nova-db, pgsql-neutron-db)
        * amqp
        * identity-service

       clients for access to console proxy. Set to local for the ip address of
       the nova-cloud-controller serving the request to be used
  console-keymap:
    type: string
    default: 'en-us'
    description: |
       Console keymap
  debug:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: Enable debug logging
  verbose:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: Enable verbose logging
  worker-multiplier:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      The CPU core multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for
      Nova and Neutron.  By default, the number of workers for each daemon
      is set to twice the number of CPU cores a service unit has.
  cpu-allocation-ratio:
    type: float
    default: 16.0
    description: |
      The per physical core -> virtual core ratio to use in the Nova scheduler.
      .
      Increasing this value will increase instance density on compute nodes
      at the expense of instance performance.
  ram-allocation-ratio:
    type: float
    default: 1.5
    description: |
      The physical ram -> virtual ram ratio to use in the Nova scheduler.
      .
      Increasing this value will increase instance density on compute nodes
      at the potential expense of instance performance.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
