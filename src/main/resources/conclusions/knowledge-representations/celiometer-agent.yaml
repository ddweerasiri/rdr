summary: Subordinate charm for deploying Ceilometer compute agent

description: |
 Ceilometer project aims to become the infrastructure to collect measurements
 within OpenStack so that no two agents would need to be written to collect
 the same data. It's primary targets are monitoring and metering, but the
 framework should be easily expandable to collect for other needs. To that
 effect, Ceilometer should be able to share collected data with a variety of consumers.
 .
 This charm should be used in conjunction with the ceilometer and nova charm to collect
 Openstack measures.

      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
      cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
      cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

      Note that updating this setting to a source that is known to
      provide a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software
      upgrade.

      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
