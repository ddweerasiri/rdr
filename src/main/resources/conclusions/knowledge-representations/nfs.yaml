summary: NFS formula for shared data storage
description: |
  Installs and configures an nfs4 daemon with
  the standard accompanying services, portmapd
  and idmapd.

  To use this, client services must implement
  hooks for a storage relation that is compatible
  with the 'mount' interface, see http://jujucharms.com/interfaces/mount.

  Exported shares get created as new services
  are joined.

  For now, service units with the same servicename
  share the same exported filesystem.
