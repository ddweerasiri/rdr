summary: Virtual Networking for OpenStack - Neutron Gateway

description: |
  Neutron is a virtual network service for Openstack, and a part of
  Netstack. Just like OpenStack Nova provides an API to dynamically
  request and configure virtual servers, Neutron provides an API to
  dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks
  connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (e.g., virtual NICs
  from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide
  advanced network capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring,
  etc.)
  .
  This URep provides central Neutron networking services as part
  of a Neutron based Openstack deployment

    type: string
    description: |
      Network configuration plugin to use for quantum.
      Supported values include:
      .
        ovs - OpenVSwitch
        nvp|nsx - Nicira NVP/VMware NSX
        n1kv - Cisco N1kv
  ext-port:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      A space-separated list of external ports to use for routing of instance
      traffic to the external public network. Valid values are either MAC
      addresses (in which case only MAC addresses for interfaces without an IP
      address already assigned will be used), or interfaces (eth0)
  data-port:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The data port will be added to br-data and will allow usage of flat or VLAN
      network types with Neutron.
  openstack-origin:
    type: string
    default: distro
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support use of additional sources such as:
      .
        - ppa:myteam/ppa
        - cloud:precise-folsom/proposed
        - cloud:precise-folsom
        - deb http://my.archive.com/ubuntu main|KEYID
      .
      Note that quantum/neutron is only supported >= Folsom.
  run-internal-router:
    type: string
    default: all
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support how the L3 agent option
      handle_internal_only_routers is configured.
      all    => Set to be true everywhere
      none   => Set to be false everywhere
      leader => Set to be true on one node (the leader) and false everywhere
                else.
      Use leader and none when configuring multiple floating pools
  external-network-id:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Optional configuration to set the external-network-id. Only needed when
      configuring multiple external networks and should be used in conjunction
      with run-internal-router.
  rabbit-user:
    type: string
    description: RabbitMQ user
    default: neutron
  rabbit-vhost:
    type: string
    description: RabbitMQ Virtual Host
    default: openstack
  nova-rabbit-user:
    type: string
    description: RabbitMQ Nova user
    default: nova
  nova-rabbit-vhost:
    type: string
    description: RabbitMQ Nova Virtual Host
    default: openstack
  debug:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: Enable debug logging
  verbose:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: Enable verbose logging
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If set to True, supporting services will log to syslog.
  instance-mtu:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Configure DHCP services to provide MTU configuration to instances
      within the cloud.  This is useful in deployments where its not
      possible to increase MTU on switches and physical servers to
      accomodate the packet overhead of using GRE tunnels.
  enable-l3-agent:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support use of linux router
      Note that this is used only for Cisco n1kv plugin.
  database-user:
    default: nova
    type: string
    description: Username for database access
  database:
    default: nova
    type: string
    description: Database name
  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate URep.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  # Network configuration options
  # by default all access is over 'private-address'
  os-data-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the OpenStack Data network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      This network will be used for tenant network traffic in overlay
      networks.
  sysctl:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      YAML-formatted associative array of sysctl key/value pairs to be set
      persistently e.g. '{ kernel.pid_max : 4194303 }'.
  # Legacy (Icehouse) HA
  ha-legacy-mode:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True will enable Pacemaker to monitor the neutron-ha-monitor daemon
      on every neutron-gateway unit, which detects neutron agents status and
      reschedule resources hosting on failed agents, detects local errors and
      release resources when network is unreachable or do neccessary recover
      tasks. This feature targets to < Juno which doesn't natively support HA
      in Neutron itself.
  ha-bindiface:
    type: string
    default: eth0
    description: |
      Default network interface on which HA cluster will bind to communicate

  ha-mcastport:
    type: int
    default: 5409
    description: |
      Default multicast port number that will be used to communicate between
      HA Cluster nodes.
