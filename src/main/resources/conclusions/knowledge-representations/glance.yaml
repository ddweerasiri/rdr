summary: "OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service"
description: |
 The Glance project provides an image registration and discovery service
 (Parallax) and an image delivery service (Teller). These services are used
 in conjunction by Nova to deliver images from object stores, such as
 OpenStack's Swift service, to Nova's compute nodes.

      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
      cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
      cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

      Note that updating this setting to a source that is known to
      provide a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software
      upgrade.

      Comma-separated list of key=value pairs to be added to glance-api.conf

      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores within the images rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the images
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
      your ceph cluster).

    default: False
    description: |
      If set to True, supporting services will log to syslog.

  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      SSL certificate to install and use for API ports.  Setting this value
      and ssl_key will enable reverse proxying, point Glance's entry in the
      Keystone catalog to use https, and override any certficiate and key
      issued by Keystone (if it is configured to do so).
  ssl_key:
    type: string

    description: SSL key to use with certificate specified as ssl_cert.
  ssl_ca:
    type: string

      This network will be used for admin endpoints.
  os-internal-network:

      This network will be used for internal endpoints.
  os-public-network:
    type: string

    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the OpenStack Public network (e.g.,

      This network will be used for public endpoints.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  worker-multiplier:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      The CPU core multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for

  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
