        description: License file for LDS.
        type: string
        default:
    landscape-password:
        description: |
            The password to use for the landscape DB user. If you change this
            post-deployment via juju set, you will have to change the password
            in the DB manually as the charm will not do it for you yet.
        type: string
        default: "landscape"
    services:
        description: |
            Landscape services listed as space-separated entries.  Valid
            services are: appserver, msgserver, pingserver, combo-loader,
            async-frontend, apiserver, package-upload, jobhandler,
            package-search, juju-sync, cron and static.
        type: string
        default: appserver msgserver pingserver combo-loader async-frontend apiserver package-upload jobhandler package-search juju-sync cron static
    service-count:
        type: string
        default: AUTO
        description: |
            Many landscape services can have multiple instances started up.  By
            altering this setting, you can increase the launch count.  A
            numeric value will tell all capable landscape services on this juju
            unit to spawn that number of instances.  Leave at the default
            of "AUTO", to let the charm determine the optimum number of
            services given the discovered properties of the box (RAM, Disk
            Space, CPU).  You can also supply a syntax of:
            "<service-name>:<number> <service-name>:<number>" as a value, to
            control the launch of individual services.  Services that cannot
            "scale" in this way will politely ignore these settings.
    maintenance:
        type: boolean
        default: False
        description: |
            Put this landscape service unit into a maintenance mode.  Stop all
            services and prevent any attempts to start them.  Cron jobs will
            also not run.  Upgrade schema attempts will still be allowed to
            process.
    upgrade-schema:
        type: boolean
        default: False
        description: |
            When daemons attempt to start, they will first try to update the
            schema (instead of just validating that it is correct).  This
            should only typically be enabled as part of a landscape maintenance
            cycle.
    admin-name:
        description: |
            Name of the account administrator. If this, admin-email and
            admin-password are specified, then the standalone account will be
            created as part of the deployment, and this person will be its
            administrator. If not specified, Landscape will prompt for these
            details when it is first accessed with a web browser. Has no
            effect if changed after a deployment.
        type: string
        default:
    admin-email:
        description: |
            Email of the account administrator. To have any effect, needs to
            specified in conjunction with admin-name and admin-password. Has
            no effect if changed after a deployment.
        type: string
        default:
    admin-password:
        description: |
            Password of the account administrator. To have any effect, needs
            to be specified in conjunction with admin-name and admin-email.
            Has no effect if changed after a deployment.
        type: string
